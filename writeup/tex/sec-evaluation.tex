\section{Evaulation}
\label{sec-evaluation}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Looking at A, B ratios for loads and stores.
  \item Put graphs and analyze them.
  \item Intuition for decrease (store is lower - mostly misses)
\end{enumerate}

%Metrics: what do you care about?
%Evaluation methodology: how did you evaluate?
%Results / discussions: if possible, provide intuitions and reasons for the
%result you got.
