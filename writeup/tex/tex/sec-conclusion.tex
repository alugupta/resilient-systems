\section{Future Directions}
\label{sec-conclusions}

There needs to be more work in low-cost authenticated encryption techniques,
specifically targetting mobile and embedded devices. One avenue is exploring
different encryption modes such as the \TT{Galois Counter Mode} which provides
both authentication and encryption primitives. It follows a similar technique
to the AES-counter mode of operation \cite{nistGCM}. Highly parallel and
efficient. Provides a tag for authentication. There must be more efficient ways
of storing the tag - coudl be large overhead (maybe do the encryption on larger
blocks to amortize the space overhead).

Also many of the work is being done for single core monolitic processors not
multi-core or heterogeneous system on chip applications.
