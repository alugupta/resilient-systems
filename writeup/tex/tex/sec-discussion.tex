\subsection{Suh - Efficient Memory Integrity and Encryption}
This paper explores efficient memory integrity verification techniques and
encryption techniques separately. It does not consider the increased power and
overhead associated with memory writes after encryption as discussed in the
following section by Duece.

\subsection{Duece}
\cite{duece} focuses on PCM (non-volatile) memory encryption and devises a
low-cost technique that is applicable to most systems - reducing the overhead
of memory writes. It uses a wide array of benchmarks (namely SPEC). It also
proposes a novel wear-leveling approach that prolongs memory lifespan. It
protects only confidentiality but not integrity. It requires 2 AES engines (1
for modified words and another for unmodified words).
