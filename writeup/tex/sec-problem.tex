\section{Problem Formulation}
\label{sec-problem}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item General - Explore the impact of memory encryption on power consumption
  \item Use various computer architecture analysis tools to simulate a series
    of memory accesses and model the energy overhead of encryption on DDR4
    memory technology
\end{enumerate}
