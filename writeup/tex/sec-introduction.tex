\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Talk about growth of mobile devices, connectivity and how mobile
    devices handle increasing amounts of sensitive data.
  \item Memory encryption has become a prominent research topic - providing low
    cost (money, area, power and design complexity) and high performance (high
    throughput, low latency) memory encryption primitives is very important.
  \item Generally memory encryption has been studied for general purpose
    processors (GPP) where power constraints are not as stringent however for
    mobile devies power is a first order design constraint.
  \item Providing low power memory encryption is very important to enable
    memory encryption for mobile devices.
  \item Characterizing the power overhead of the memory system is still an open
    problem - especially in the context of encryption.
  \item Talk about the two main sources of power consumption \fixme{add
    pictures of dram chip toplogies}
  \item We use first order approximations to model the power overhead of
    encrypting data on the memory system.
  \item We verify that encrypted data has a significant power overhead \fixme{
    add numbers}
  \item Outline the paper's sections
