To Build 

Type make at the command line to create the DRAMsim executable.

To Run

The run.pl perl script can be used to run the simulator in stand-alone mode.

The required configuration files for the various DRAM types reside in the
mem_system_def directory. For dram types where both power and performance
simulation is supported, there are two configuration files - an spd file for
the timing parameters and a dsh file for the power parameters.

Trace file can also be used as input to the simulator.

For more documentation refer to our white paper and the simulator manual.

For porting the mem-interface.c is to be used as specified in the white paper.
The mem-interface.h provides definitions of data types etc. 
The function defintion of fill_biu_slot (decalred in mem-biu.h and defined in
mem-biu.c) might require modification.
